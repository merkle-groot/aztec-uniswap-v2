# Token Contract

The `Token` contract implements an ERC-20-like token with Aztec-specific privacy extensions. It supports transfers and interactions through both private and public balances, offering full coverage of Aztec's confidentiality features.

This implementation provides a robust foundation for fungible tokens on Aztec, enabling developers to build applications with flexible privacy controls and seamless interoperability between private and public states.

## AIP-20: Aztec Token Standard

This contract follows the [AIP-20 Aztec Token Standard](https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-comments-aip-20-aztec-token-standard/7737). Feel free to review and discuss the specification on the Aztec forum.

## AIP-4626: Aztec Tokenized Vault Standard

Optionally, the `Token` contract can be configured as a Tokenized Vault. Learn more [here](#aip-4626-aztec-tokenized-vault-standard-1).

## Storage Fields

- `name: str<31>`: Token name (compressed).
- `symbol: str<31>`: Token symbol (compressed).
- `decimals: u8`: Decimal precision.
- `private_balances: Map<AztecAddress, BalanceSet>`: Private balances per account.
- `public_balances: Map<AztecAddress, u128>`: Public balances per account.
- `total_supply: u128`: Total token supply.
- `minter: AztecAddress`: Authorized minter address (if set).
- `upgrade_authority: AztecAddress`: Address allowed to perform contract upgrades (zero address if not upgradeable).

## AIP-4626: Aztec Tokenized Vault Standard

The Token contract (as of now the Tokenized Vault) follows the [AIP-4626: Tokenized Vault Standard](https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-comments-aip-4626-tokenized-vault/8079) when configured appropriately. Feel free to review and discuss the specification on the Aztec forum.

### Tokenized Vault Functions

This contract also implements yield-bearing vault functionality when initialized with `constructor_with_asset` or `constructor_with_asset_initial_deposit`. The vault allows users to deposit underlying assets and receive shares representing their proportional ownership of the growing asset pool. The design is an adaptation of the [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626). While the Tokenized Vault contract publicly holds the underlying asset deposits and accrued yield, shares can be held either publicly or privately. Likewise, underlying assets can be deposited from or withdrawn to both public and private balances.

> ⚠️ **WARNING — Private Balance Loss**
>
> any asset tokens transferred to the Tokenized Vault's private balance will be lost forever, as the contract doesn't have keys to spend a private balance nor any recovery mechanism. Yield must be sent to the Vault's public balance.

> ⚠️ **WARNING — Experimental Feature**
>
> the AIP-4626 functionality of this contract is not yet production ready. Use it at your own risk. In particular there is a known overflow issue in the asset<>share conversion logic used on deposits and withdrawals. This can corrupt balances for sufficiently large inputs.

#### Function Patterns

Some Tokenized Vault private methods require both `assets` and `shares` amounts as inputs because the exchange rate cannot be computed within the private context. To accommodate this, two complementary patterns are provided:

**Standard Pattern** (e.g., deposit_public_to_private): 
- Exchange rate is provided by the user, giving `assets` and `shares` as inputs.
- Best when exchange rate is known and stable.
- Any slippage or miscalculation will either cause the transaction to revert or leave the difference in favor of the vault (never the user).
- Can be more gas-efficient in certain cases.

**Exact Pattern** (e.g., deposit_public_to_private_exact): 
- Enforces the exact exchange rate at public execution time.
- A portion of the tokens is immediately transferred privately, allowing users to use them in other protocols, while any outstanding or surplus amount is settled privately during public execution via partial notes.
- Best for volatile exchange rates and when slippage could cause significant losses.
- May be more expensive due to the additional settlement logic.

##### `max_*` and `preview_*` patterns

Because the vault supports both public and private flows, the `max_*` and `preview_*` families should be interpreted as **helper interfaces** rather than hard guarantees.

**Max Pattern (`max_deposit`, `max_issue`, `max_withdraw`, `max_redeem`)**
- These functions express *policy limits* (caps, pausing, allowlists, etc.) for integrators and frontends.
- In privacy-preserving contexts, these limits are often only *fully enforceable* in **public execution / settlement** (where state and balances can be queried without leaking private information).
- As a result, `max_*` should be treated as **advisory** unless a deployment explicitly enforces them in the relevant public execution path(s).
- Note that `max_withdraw` / `max_redeem` typically only reflect **public share balances** (private holders must track private balances off-chain).

**Preview Pattern (`preview_deposit`, `preview_issue`, `preview_withdraw`, `preview_redeem`)**
- These functions simulate outcomes using the **current public state** (e.g., `total_assets`, `total_supply`) and the same conversion logic as the corresponding operation.
- Previews are intended for quoting and UX; they do not account for private state and do not guarantee execution success if state changes before settlement.
- Previews follow the vault’s rounding rules and reflect the amounts that would be computed at public execution time under current on-chain state.

> ℹ️ **NOTE — `max_*` and `preview_*` semantics**
>
> The `max_*` functions (`max_deposit`, `max_issue`, `max_withdraw`, `max_redeem`) are exposed as view helpers and are implemented via contract library methods (`_max_*`) so integrators can override policy (caps, pausing, allowlists, etc.).
>
> **Important:** In a privacy-preserving vault, not all entrypoints can safely or deterministically enforce address-dependent limits (e.g. some private flows cannot accept `owner/receiver` without leaking it, and some exchange-rate checks must be performed during public settlement). For this reason, `max_*` should be treated as *advisory* unless a deployment explicitly enforces it in the relevant public execution path(s).
>
> By default, `_max_deposit` and `_max_issue` return `MAX_U128_VALUE` (no limit), while `_max_withdraw` and `_max_redeem` only consider the owner’s **public** share balance.

##### Privacy leaks

In the current implementation the functions `deposit_public_to_private`, `deposit_public_to_private_exact` and `issue_public_to_private` can leak the `to` address. Although they are private functions, all other input parameters become public during execution, which allows an attacker to brute-force candidate `to` addresses until finding one that matches the authwit hash. This limitation will be addressed in a future update.

Also note that several other functions rely on unpredictable nonces for privacy. If private nonces are guessable or reused, additional operations could become vulnerable to similar privacy leaks. Always ensure nonces are generated in a way that is infeasible to predict.

### Vault Deployment Guide

The Tokenized Vault can be deployed using two different initializers, each offering different security tradeoffs. Understanding these options is essential for vault deployers.

#### Deployment with `constructor_with_asset`

This initializer deploys the vault **without an initial deposit**:

```rust
#[public]
#[initializer]
fn constructor_with_asset(
    name: str<31>,
    symbol: str<31>,
    decimals: u8,
    asset: AztecAddress,
    offset: u128,
    upgrade_authority: AztecAddress,
) { /* ... */ }
```

When using this deployment method, the vault relies on a **virtual shares offset** mechanism to mitigate inflation (donation) attacks. The deployer specifies the `offset` value during deployment:

```rust
// Example: deploying with offset = 1
let offset: u128 = 1;
Token::interface().constructor_with_asset(name, symbol, decimals, asset, offset, upgrade_authority)
```

This offset introduces virtual assets and virtual shares into the exchange-rate calculation. By doing so, it **dampens exchange-rate manipulation and reduces rounding-based griefing**, which is a key enabler of inflation attacks in empty or near-empty ERC-4626 vaults.

Increasing the offset generally makes early-stage manipulation more expensive and reduces the attacker's ability to force victims into receiving zero or negligible shares. However, larger offsets also affect share pricing for small deposits and can introduce UX and accounting tradeoffs. As a result, **choosing an appropriate offset is a balance between security and precision**.

It is the **deployer's responsibility** to evaluate whether `offset = 1` provides sufficient protection for their specific use case, or if a larger value is needed. Factors to consider include:

- Expected minimum and typical deposit sizes
- Likelihood of front-running or MEV
- Whether the vault exposes methods where users supply both `assets` and `shares` (common for private flows where the exchange rate cannot be computed inside the private context)
- The overall risk profile and value secured by the vault

For a detailed analysis of virtual offsets as a mitigation strategy, see:  
https://www.openzeppelin.com/news/a-novel-defense-against-erc4626-inflation-attacks

> ⚠️ **WARNING — Inflation Attack Risk**
>
> Empty or nearly-empty ERC-4626 vaults are vulnerable to **inflation attacks** (also known as donation attacks). An attacker can manipulate the share-to-asset exchange rate by front-running early deposits with a combination of a small deposit and a large donation. This can cause victims to receive zero or negligible shares for their deposit, effectively stranding their assets in the vault.
>
> This class of attack is most effective when total assets are low and deposits can be front-run. On Aztec, some private vault methods accept both `assets` and `shares` as inputs (because the exchange rate may not be computable inside the private context). If callers can choose these values freely (or if integrators don't enforce conservative bounds), manipulation and rounding issues can become easier to exploit.
>
> **An `offset = 1` provides baseline protection, but may not be sufficient in all scenarios—particularly when multiple deposits can be front-run or when very small deposits are expected.**

#### Deployment with `constructor_with_asset_initial_deposit`

For stronger protection, this initializer allows the vault to be seeded with an initial deposit at deployment time:

```rust
#[public]
#[initializer]
fn constructor_with_asset_initial_deposit(
    name: str<31>,
    symbol: str<31>,
    decimals: u8,
    asset: AztecAddress,
    offset: u128,
    upgrade_authority: AztecAddress,
    initial_deposit: u128,
    depositor: AztecAddress,
    _nonce: Field,
) { /* ... */ }
```

The `depositor` can be any address that provides an authwit for the `initial_deposit` amount on the asset token. During initialization:

1. The specified `initial_deposit` of assets is transferred from the `depositor` to the vault
2. Corresponding shares are minted to an address that **cannot redeem them** (in this implementation: the vault contract address itself)
3. These shares are permanently locked and act as **dead shares**

This approach is inspired by mitigation strategies used in production systems (e.g., Morpho-style vault seeding). By establishing a non-trivial initial asset and share base, early exchange-rate manipulation becomes economically impractical.

Rather than relying on virtual math alone, this method ensures that an attacker would need to commit **economically significant capital relative to the initial deposit and expected user deposits** in order to meaningfully influence the exchange rate.

> ℹ️ **NOTE — Deployment Preparation**
>
> The initial deposit is executed internally via a `transfer_public_to_public` call on the underlying asset token. As a result:
>
> - The `depositor` **must hold the `initial_deposit` amount in their public balance**
> - An **authwit must be signed** authorizing this public transfer
> - The **vault contract address must be known in advance** in order to correctly compute and sign the authwit
>
> Deployers should ensure the vault address is precomputed and that the depositor’s public balance and authorization are set up prior to deployment.

**Alternative Setup**

`constructor_with_asset_initial_deposit` also supports an alternative flow that allows transferring the initial deposit directly to the vault before deployment, instead of providing it via authwit. To enable this, set `depositor` to the vault’s precomputed address and transfer `initial_deposit` asset tokens to the vault before deploying it. By doing this, `initial_deposit` will be gulped by the vault at initialization.

**Choosing the Initial Deposit Amount:**

- The deposit should be large enough that the donation required to round the smallest expected user deposits down to zero is economically unfeasible or orders of magnitude larger than the expected attacker's profit.
- A common heuristic is to seed the vault with an amount comparable to, or larger than, early expected inflows. However, beware that asset's decimals play an important role here:
    - 18 decimals (e.g. DAI): if the smallest, economically significant user deposit is expected to be 1 DAI, an initial deposit of 1 DAI would mean that an attacker would need one quintillion DAIs (10^18 DAI) to exploit 1-DAI deposits. Even a smaller initial deposit would probably be enough.
    - 6 decimals (e.g USDC): an attacker would need in comparison only 1 million USDC to exploit 1-USDC deposits. It might still be a strong protection against donation attacks in some cases, but it does not make them unfeasible.
- Larger deposits provide stronger protection but represent permanently locked capital.

> ⚠️ **NOTE — Dead Shares Should Be Unrecoverable**
>
> Dead shares are intended to remain permanently locked and are not expected to be redeemed under normal operation. Deployers should ensure that any upgrade or governance process preserves this invariant.

#### Combining Offset and Dead Shares

For maximum robustness, the virtual offset mechanism can be combined with an initial deposit:

- The **offset** provides baseline protection against rounding-based manipulation
- The **initial deposit** establishes meaningful initial liquidity, making economic attacks impractical

This layered approach is recommended for deployments where the vault is expected to accept deposits immediately after deployment and/or secure significant value.
